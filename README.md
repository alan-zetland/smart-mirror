# smart-mirror
The code to accompany my Instructable on building a motion sensing smart mirror.

A few points to note:
1. I have placed a few variables at the top that you need to review and change for your own uses (eg the calendar api etc).
2. The code was produced initially for my own personal use, so I make no claims as to its quality or "cleanliness", and I won't be trying to justify it to anyone.
3. It's not "production-ready" - of course it works for my own purposes but I would clean it up, restructure it and add all sorts of error trapping if I was to write this for an actual website.
4. I don't provide any support for the code, it is provided as-is, please use as you see fit.  I'd be grateful if you would leave the line giving my details at the top though as a means of providing credit (as I have with the sources below).
